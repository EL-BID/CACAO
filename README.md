## Minimalist setup for DEVELOPMENT 

For running the web component locally at a development desktop with minimal setup, you should follow these steps:

1. Install, configure and start a node of ElasticSearch (version 7.14.1) locally. At least one node should be enough.

2. Compile/build the ***CACAO Web project*** . If you are using an IDE such as Eclipse, the automatic build should be enough. 

3. Run the application using developer application properties, referring to the property file using command line arguments. You may use the internal file 'dev.properties' like this:

> --spring.config.additional-location=classpath:dev.properties

4. Access the front page using your browser. Confirm/bypass the security warning related to the unsafe self-signed certificate being used with the developer configuration.

> https://127.0.0.1:8888/

5. For a initial empty database, use the following login credentials:

> Login: admin@admin
>
> Password: 123456
