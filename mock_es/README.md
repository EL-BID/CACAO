# CACAO_MOCK_ES

This module implements a utility to be used with TEST UNIT CASES of other modules.

The utility is a 'Mocked Elastic Search' service.

Using this utility the other modules are capable of using an 'in-memory' ElasticSearch service, with just a few capabilities implemented, that should be enough for test unit cases.
