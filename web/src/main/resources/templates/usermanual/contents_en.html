Once the `Upload Documents` has been selected, it is necessary to indicate what type of document will be sent to CACAO.

The 'Document Template' dropdown menu shows all the possible types of documents that CACAO can receive and validate.

The functionality to choose the file is dependent on the Operating System that is being used on the user's equipment. Please refer to your operating system manual if you have questions about how to use this feature.

After selecting the file, a window will open to confirm that you want to send the file. Select `Yes` to send the file, or `No` to go back.

Once the file is sent, the CACAO system will inform you if the operation was successful.

<span class="ui header">Vertical and Horizontal Analysis</span>
</div>
<div class="content markdown">
## What's the purpose of a Vertical and Horizontal Analysis?

The **vertical analysis** presents the financial statement for the period so that level 1 of the statement (Category) equals 100%, and then the percentage that each element of item 2 (subcategory) represents of this 100% is presented, and so on.

For instance:

|Level|Category|SubCategory |Comparison|
|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|**Asset**||**100%**|
|2|Asset|Cash and Cash Equivalents|66,67%|
|2|Asset|Intenvory|33,33%|

The **horizontal analysis** compares two periods side by side, including a third column that shows how much the second period represents in relation to the first, which is considered 100%.

For instance:

|Level|Category|SubCategory|First Period|Second Period|Comparison|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|**Asset**||**1500**|**1050**|**70%**|
|2|Asset|Cash and Cash Equivalents|1000|450|45%|
|2|Asset|Inventory|500|600|120%|

It is also possible to perform **both analysis** simultaneously. In this situation, after the information for the first period, there will be the vertical comparison column. After the information for the second period, there will be the horizontal comparison.

|Level|Category|SubCategory|First Period|Vertical Comparison|Second Period|Horizontal Comparison|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|**Asset**||**1500**|**100%**|**1050**|**70%**|
|2|Asset|Cash and Cash Equivalents|1000|66,67%|450|45%|
|2|Asset|Inventory|500|33,33%|600|120%|
