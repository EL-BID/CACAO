## What is CACAO?
CACAO is a system maintained by the Tax Administration for receiving and maintaining files with accounting data of taxpayers.

## What does CACAO stands for?
CACAO is a Spanish acronym for *Sistema de **C**onsulta y **A**lmacenamiento de Datos **C**ontables y **A**poyo **O**rganizativo*, which translates to "System for Consulting and Storing Accounting Data and Organizational Support."

## Login to the CACAO system

Use the `Start CACAO` button located in the center of the system homepage, or click on the `Start CACAO` option in the upper right corner to access the authenticated area of the CACAO system.

```
Attention! The CACAO system allows secure access in several ways.
```

By clicking on `Sign in with Google`, `Sign in with Microsoft` or `Sign in with Facebook`, the user can log in using his or her account with these providers, without the need to create a password specific to CACAO. **This is the recommended model for access.**

To access CACAO using a login/password, please contact the Tax Administration.

## The Sidebar menu

All functionalities of the CACAO system can be accessed through the sidebar menu.

```
Attention! The sidebar menu is located on the upper left corner, identified by 3 stacked bars. 
```
After logging in to CACAO, or selecting the `Home` option in the sidebar menu, a card interface will be presented with shortcuts to CACAO's most commonly used features.

## How to upload documents

Use the `Upload Documents` option located in the sidebar menu.

Once the `Upload Documents` has been selected, it is necessary to indicate what type of document will be sent to CACAO.

The 'Document Template' dropdown menu shows all the possible types of documents that CACAO can receive and validate.

```
Attention! Sending documents of models that do not exist in CACAO, or choosing a model different from the one that represents the file that will be sent, will cause the rejection of the document by CACAO.
``` 
Select from the dropdown menu which type of file you want to send. The `Upload file` button will become available. When you select the `Upload file' button, the functionality for choosing which file to send will open.

The functionality to choose the file is dependent on the Operating System that is being used on the user's equipment. Please refer to your operating system manual if you have questions about how to use this feature.

After selecting the file, a window will open to confirm that you want to send the file. Select `Yes` to send the file, or `No` to go back.

Once the file is sent, the CACAO system will inform you if the operation was successful. 

## Checking the uploaded files and their situation.

In order to check the uploaded files or to check the validation status of each of them, use the `All Uploads` option located in the sidebar menu.

A table with all the documents uploaded will be presented. This table shows:

* The **User** who uploaded the file
* The **Taxpayer ID** to whom the file refers
* The **Tax Period** the file refers
* The **Template** indicating the type of file sent
* The **Upload date/time**
* The **Situation** of the file. The possible situations are:
	* Received
	* Accepted
	* Valid
	* Invalid
	* Pending
	* Processed
	* Replaced
	
There are also 3 functions available for each upload:

* Show the **situation history**, identified by a `file` icon
* Show the **error messages**, if any, that occurred during the file validation, identified by a `warning sign` icon
* **Download** the file, identified by a `floppy disk`icon
