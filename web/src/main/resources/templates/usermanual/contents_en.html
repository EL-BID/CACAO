## How to upload documents

Use the `Upload Documents` option located in the sidebar menu.

Once the `Upload Documents` has been selected, it is necessary to indicate what type of document will be sent to CACAO.

The 'Document Template' dropdown menu shows all the possible types of documents that CACAO can receive and validate.

```
Attention! Sending documents of models that do not exist in CACAO, or choosing a model different from the one that represents the file that will be sent, will cause the rejection of the document by CACAO.
``` 
Select from the dropdown menu which type of file you want to send. The `Upload file` button will become available. When you select the `Upload file' button, the functionality for choosing which file to send will open.

The functionality to choose the file is dependent on the Operating System that is being used on the user's equipment. Please refer to your operating system manual if you have questions about how to use this feature.

After selecting the file, a window will open to confirm that you want to send the file. Select `Yes` to send the file, or `No` to go back.

Once the file is sent, the CACAO system will inform you if the operation was successful. 

## Checking the uploaded files and their situation.
