## What is CACAO?
CACAO is a system maintained by the Tax Administration for receiving and maintaining files with accounting data of taxpayers.

## What does CACAO stands for?
CACAO is a Spanish acronym for *Sistema de **C**onsulta y **A**lmacenamiento de Datos **C**ontables y **A**poyo **O**rganizativo*, which translates to "System for Consulting and Storing Accounting Data and Organizational Support."

## How to upload documents

Use the `Upload Documents` option located in the sidebar menu.

Once the `Upload Documents` has been selected, it is necessary to indicate what type of document will be sent to CACAO.

The 'Document Template' dropdown menu shows all the possible types of documents that CACAO can receive and validate.

> **Attention!**
> Sending documents of models that do not exist in CACAO, or choosing a model different from the one that represents the file that will be sent, will cause the rejection of the document by CACAO.
 
Select from the dropdown menu which type of file you want to send. The `Upload file` button will become available. When you select the `Upload file' button, the functionality for choosing which file to send will open.

The functionality to choose the file is dependent on the Operating System that is being used on the user's equipment. Please refer to your operating system manual if you have questions about how to use this feature.

After selecting the file, a window will open to confirm that you want to send the file. Select `Yes` to send the file, or `No` to go back.

Once the file is sent, the CACAO system will inform you if the operation was successful. 

## Checking the uploaded files and their situation.

In order to check the uploaded files or to check the validation status of each of them, use the `All Uploads` option located in the sidebar menu.

A table with all the documents uploaded will be presented. This table shows:

* The **User** who uploaded the file
* The **Taxpayer ID** to whom the file refers
* The **Tax Period** the file refers
* The **Template** indicating the type of file sent
* The **Upload date/time**
* The **Situation** of the file. The possible situations are:
	* **Received** - The file has been received by CACAO
	* **Accepted** - The validation process accepted to begin reviewing the file 
	* **Valid** - The file has been validated and its format comply with the document template
	* **Invalid** - The file has been rejected for not complying with the document template
	* **Pending** - The file is waiting for another file to be uploaded, in order to the ETL process to begin
	* **Processed** - The ETL process has been executed on this file
	* **Replaced** - This file has been replaced by another file.
	
> **Attention!**
> CACAO applies **two** sequential processes: 
> * _File validation_, when CACAO validates each file against the document template.
> * _Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)_, when CACAO reads the data from the validated files, performs various calculations and transformations, and stores the results on its own database.  
> 
> For more information on documents templates, please refer to the `Managing Document Templates` entry of this user manual. 
	
There are also 3 functions available for each upload:

* Show the **situation history**, identified by a `file` icon
* Show the **error messages**, if any, that occurred during the file validation, identified by a `warning sign` icon
* **Download** the file, identified by a `floppy disk`icon

<span class="ui header">Vertical and Horizontal Analysis</span>
</div>
<div class="content markdown">
## What's the purpose of a Vertical and Horizontal Analysis?

The vertical and horizontal analysis allows the visualization of the state of a single taxpayer. The data source for these analyses is the journal uploaded by the Taxpayer.

The **vertical analysis** presents the financial statement for the period so that level 1 of the statement (Category) equals 100%, and then the percentage that each element of item 2 (subcategory) represents of this 100% is presented, and so on.

For instance:

|Level|Category|SubCategory |Comparison|
|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|**Asset**||**100%**|
|2|Asset|Cash and Cash Equivalents|66,67%|
|2|Asset|Inventory|33,33%|

The **horizontal analysis** compares two periods side by side, including a third column that shows how much the second period represents in relation to the first, which is considered 100%.

For instance:

|Level|Category|SubCategory|First Period|Second Period|Comparison|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|**Asset**||**1500**|**1050**|**70%**|
|2|Asset|Cash and Cash Equivalents|1000|450|45%|
|2|Asset|Inventory|500|600|120%|

It is also possible to perform **both analyses** simultaneously. In this situation, after the information for the first period, there will be the vertical comparison column. After the information for the second period, there will be the horizontal comparison.

|Level|Category|SubCategory|First Period|Vertical Comparison|Second Period|Horizontal Comparison|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**1**|**Asset**||**1500**|**100%**|**1050**|**70%**|
|2|Asset|Cash and Cash Equivalents|1000|66,67%|450|45%|
|2|Asset|Inventory|500|33,33%|600|120%|

## Using the Vertical and Horizontal Analysis

To use the vertical and horizontal analysis, select the `Analysis` option located at the sidebar menu, then select `Vertical and Horizontal Analysis`.

It's mandatory to select a Taxpayer by its *name* or *Taxpayer Id* from the **Name** menu. You can scroll the list of taxpayers or input the name or taxpayer id.

The next step is to choose the analysis type. It's possible to choose from:

* **Vertical** analysis
* **Horizontal** analysis
* **Both** vertical and horizontal analysis

The third step is to select the **base period**. The base period is the first period in all comparisons.

In the fourth step, it must be select the periodicity of the analysis. This selection controls the periods that will be compared to the base period.

The last step is to select the levels of the chart of accounts that will be displayed:

* **Level 1** - only the category will be shown
* **Level 2** - both category and subcategory will be shown
* **Level 3** - The category, subcategory and account will be shown

It's possible to show accounts with *zero* balance, selecting the `Show accounts with ZERO balance`option.

With all the selections made, select `Search` to retrieve the data and the analysis desired.

<span class="ui header">General Analysis</span>
</div>
<div class="content markdown">
## What's the purpose of a General Analysis?

The General Analysis allows you to evaluate the result of a group of taxpayers. The data source for the general analysis can be the journal sent by the taxpayers, or the statement of income for the year. With this analysis, it is possible to graphically visualize the behavior patterns of the taxpayers, as well as identify those with discrepant behavior.

For a given group of taxpayers that share a common qualifier, the general analysis shows for each entry of the Journal/Declared Income Statement a **boxplot** representing the dispersion of the taxpayers.

> **Attention!**
> The qualifiers are defined by the Tax Administration and may differ for each jurisdiction. 


The **boxplot** is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles. On CACAO, the boxplot shows:

* **Minimum** (Q0 or 0th percentile): the lowest data point in the data set excluding any outliers
* **Maximum** (Q4 or 100th percentile): the highest data point in the data set excluding any outliers
* **Median** (Q2 or 50th percentile): the middle value in the data set
* **First quartile** (Q1 or 25th percentile): it is the median of the lower half of the dataset.
* **Third quartile** (Q3 or 75th percentile): it is the median of the upper half of the dataset.
* **Outliers**: data points that differ significantly from the rest of the dataset are plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers on the boxplot.

If you hover your mouse pointer over a boxplot on CACAO, a tooltip will be shown with the detailed information represented by the boxplot.

Whenever a outlier is identified, it will be shown on the boxplot as a **dot**, and the taxypayer identification for this outlier will also be detailed on the auxiliary table next to the boxplots.

The image containing all boxplots can be downloaded selecting the `...` button on the upper right of the boxplot area. The data on the auxiliary table can be downloaded selecting the `XLS` button on the lower left corner of the table.

## Using the General Analysis

To use the General  analysis, select the `Analysis` option located at the sidebar menu, then select `General Analysis`.
 
The first step for the General Analysis is to choose the qualifier for the taxpayer's group that will be subjected to the analysis. That's achievable scrolling through the **Qualifiers** menu. 

Once the Qualifier is selected, the qualifier value must be chosen from the **Qualifier Values** menu.

The third step is selecting the data source, which can be:

* The data calculated by CACAO from the **Journal** of each taxpayer
* The data submitted by the taxpayer on the **Declared Income Statment**

The last step is to choose the base period for creating the General Analysis, on the **Base Period** menu. 

With all the selections made, select `Search` to retrieve the data and the analysis desired.

## What is the purpose of the Accounting Flows analysis?

The **Accounting Flows** analysis graphically shows the _double-entry bookkeeping_ used by the taxpayer to create the journal presented to the Tax Administration.

Each financial transaction is recorded in at least two different ledger accounts, one being a **credit entry** and the other being a **debit entry**. Multiple credits or debits entries may exist on a single financial transaction, given that the sum of all credits of a transaction equals the sum of all its debits.

Each transaction is represented by an _arrow_ starting from the account being **credited** and ending on the account being **debited**. If multiple financial transactions starts and ends on the same accounts, its values are summed and the arrow connecting the two accounts gets thicker. 

> **Attention!**
> The **thicker** an arrow connecting two accounts are, the greater the sum of the financial transactions connecting the two accounts.

## Using the Accounting Flows analysis

To use the General analysis, select the `Analysis` option located at the sidebar menu, then select `Accounting Flows`.

On the **Name** menu, select the taxpayer that will be subjected to the analysis.

In order to select the period of the analysis, select the start date on the **Initial Date** menu, and the end date on the **Final Date** menu.

With all the selections made, the accounting flows will be shown.

> **Attention!**
> If will **hover** the mouse over an arrow, the sum of the financial transactions connecting the two accounts will be show.   

### Filters

The **Accounting Flows** has two main filters: **selected account** and **value range**.

If you click on a single account, only the arrows connecting this account will be shown. The moment you click anywhere on the accounting flows, all arrows available return.

On the upper side of the accounting flows, there is a dispersion graphic where each **dot** represents an arrow. The dots are displayed accordingly to its value, and the x-axis of the graphic represents all possible values. Changing the position of the left and right bar of the graphic along its x-axis controls which arrows are displayed.

<div class="content markdown">
## What are Interpersonal Relationships?

Usually a taxpayer has multiple relationships with other persons, who are taxpayers themselves. A legal entity might have a director, a natural person might have an accountant, and so on.

Registering those interpersonal relationships allows for one taxpayer to submit or access data to CACAO on behalf of another taxpayer.

## Interpersonal Relationships list

To list and manage the Interpersonal Relationships, select the `Interpersonal Relationships` option located at the sidebar menu.

A table with a list of interpersonal relationships will be shown. For each relationship in the list, the following are available:

* **Referring Person**, which indicates the "origin" of the relationship
* **Referred Person**, which indicates the "destiny" of the relationship
* The **Relationship Type**, such as _accountant_ or _legal representative_
* An indication if the relationship was **removed** from the pool of active interpersonal relationships
* A `trash` icon for removing a relationship.

> **Atention!**
> CACAO must store all interpersonal relationships in order to create a _log_ for auditing purposes. That way, a relationship is never **removed** from the system, but only put on a inactive state that does not allow any further access to the *Referring Person* data by the *Referred Person*. 

## Interpersonal Relationship Creation

To create a new Interpersonal Relationship, select the `New Interpersonal Relationship` button on the bottom left of the Interpersonal Relationship's table.

A interface for inserting the Interpersonal Relationships information is displayed. After fulfilling all required information, select the `Save` button.

## Editing user information

CACAO does not allows editing an Interpersonal Relationship. You must remove the relationship using the `Trash` icon than create a new one.

<span class="ui header">Domain Tables</span>
</div>
<div class="content markdown">
## What is the purpose of Domain Tables in CACAO?

Some of the data that a Tax Administration receives must adhere to a specific domain in order to be proper validated. For instance, there are different sets of standards that govern financial reporting and accounting, and the Tax Administration must establish which ones will be accepted and validated.

The **Domain Tables** functionality allows the Tax Administration to define sets of custom domains for the data that will be included in the files to be uploaded by the taxpayer to CACAO.

The domain is the collection of all of the objects in a system. In CACAO, a domain specifies all the possible values a given data may represent.

## Domain Tables examples

One of the most simple specific domain necessary for a accounting data is the **nature** of a financial transaction. Usually this domain contains only two values: _debit_ or _credit_. 

Setting up a **Financial Transaction nature** domain with only the _debit_ and _credit_ values informs CACAO that any other value for this domain must not be accepted, and the the file uploaded to CACAO will be rejected.

> **Attention!**
> In CACAO, domain tables are **language sensitive**. So it the Tax Administration is running CACAO on a multilanguage environment, the domain tables must indicate all possible values for each language accepted. For instance, a **Financial Transaction nature** domain table might looks as the following:
> |Entry Key|Entry Language|Entry Description|
> |-|-|-|
> |D|English|Debit|
> |C|English|Debit|
> |D|Spanish|Débito|
> |C|Spanish|Crédito|

Other example of a specific domain is the accounting standard used. A Tax Administration might accept both IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), and as such CACAO must be configured with two domain tables, one for each standard. For instance:

**IFRS Account Category Domain Table excerpt**

|Entry Key|Entry Language|Entry Description|
|-|-|-|
|1|English|Asset|
|1|Spanish|Activo|
|2|English|Equity|
|2|Spanish|Patrimonio Neto|
|3|English|Liability|
|3|Spanish|Pasivo|

**GAAP Account Category Domain Table excerpt**

|Entry Key|Entry Language|Entry Description|
|-|-|-|
|1|English|Asset|
|1|Spanish|Activo|
|2|English|Liability|
|2|Spanish|Passivo|
|3|English|Equity|
|3|Spanish|Patrimonio Neto|

Close inspection of the two domain tables shows that IFRS and GAAP uses the same account category code for **Asset**, but different codes for **Liabilities** and **Equities**. Without the domain tables definitions, CACAO would not be able to understand those differences.

## Managing the Domain Tables

To manage the Domain Tables, select the `Domain Tables` option located at the sidebar menu. A table will be shown with all the Domain tables already registered in CACAO.

For each domain table, it will be shown:
* The **Name** of the domain table
* The **Version** of the domain table
* The **Group** that the domain table is part of
* A `pen and paper` icon representing the **Edit Domain table** function
* A `trash` icon representing the **Delete Domain table** function

> **Attention!**
> If you click on a Domain table, or on the `pen and paper` icon, both actions will take you to the **Edit Domain Table** function.

In order to create a new **Domain Table**, select the `New Domain Table` button on the lower left corner of the Domain tables list.

On the **New Domain Table** page, insert the name of the domain table on the **Name** menu, the version of the table on the **Version** menu, and the group (if any) that the domain table belongs on the **Group** menu.

Select the `Save` button to create the Domain Table.

In order to add the entries to the domain table, insert the entry label on the **Entry Key** menu, select the language of the entry on the **Entry Language** menu, and insert the entry description on the **Entry Description** menu.

Select the `Add` button to insert the entry on the Domain Table.

> **Attention!**
> In order to persist the changes to the domain tables (changes to the table name, version or group, and inserts, deletes or edit of table entries), you must select the `Save` button. Otherwise the changes will be lost.
 
The same procedure for adding entries can be used to edit informations on the domain table.

<span class="ui header">Managing Document Templates - Not yet Complete</span>
</div>
<div class="content markdown">

## What are Document Templates in CACAO?

CACAO is a system for receiving and maintaining files with accounting data of taxpayers. In order to correctly receive files and validate them, CACAO must know beforehand its layout and how to interpret its data. 

> **Attention!**
> Each of the document templates available on the `Upload Documents` functionality must be informed and specified on the `Document Templates` option prior to its use.


A **Document Template** contains the following information:

* The **Name** of the template
* The **Version** of the template, used to keep a historical log of the template modifications
* The **Periodicity** that the information must be sent by the Taxpayers to the Tax Administration
* A **group** identification to consolidate different templates regarding a common goal
* If the template is **Active**, meaning that its possible to upload files with this template
* It the template is **Required**, meaning that for CACAO to properly assess the accounting data, a file with this template must be submitted 
* A list of **Fields**. For each field of the template, it must be informed:
	* Field **Name**
 	* The **type** of the information of the field
 	* The **Mapping** of the information to specific information expected by CACAO
 	* If the information:
		* contains **Personal data**
		* is **required** of **optional**
		* must be **unique** inside the file
* A **description** of the field

The **type** of the field indicates the format that CACAO must expect when reading the field. CACAO understand different types, such as:

* **Character**: a string of alphanumeric characters
* **Integer**: a number without decimal divisions, such as "12"
* **Decimal**: a number that accepts decimal divisions, such as "12,34"
* **Boolean**: a field containing only "true" or "false"
* **Date/Time**: information with a date *and* a time
* **Date**: a date containing day, month and year
* **Month**: the identification of a single month
* **Domain Specific**: a special type of field defined by the Tax Administration
* **Nested Structure**: a field composed by other fields

> **Attention!**
> For more information regarding the **Domain Specific** field type, please refer to the `Domain Tables` entry on this user manual.

The **mapping** of a field matches its information with one of the specific information expected by CACAO:

* Any Field (when the field does not have a specific mapping)
* Taxpayer ID
* Tax Year
* Tax Semester
* Tax Month
* Tax Day
* Tax Due Value
* Tax Code
* Tax 

The following table shows a small example of a Field list from a Chart of Accounts:

|Name|Type|Mapping|Personal Data|Required|Unique|Description|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Identification|Character|Taxpayer ID|Yes|Yes|Yes|Taxpayer Identification Number|
|Year|Integer|Tax Year|No|Yes|Yes|Fiscal year of this financial reporting|
|Address|Character|Any Field|No|No|No|Taxpayer work address|

## Document Inputs

Each Document Template must have at least one **Document Input** in order to be submitted to CACAO. A Document input shows CACAO how to find the fields of a Document Template within a specific file format.

CACAO can read the following file formats, that can be used as Document Inputs:

* **CSV** - Comma separated values
* **XML** - Extensible Markup Language
* **XLS** - Excel spreadsheets
* **JSON** - JavaScript Object Notation
* **PDF** - PDF forms
* **DOC** - Microsoft Word

Each input type has its own characteristics. CACAO tries its best to match the content of the files with the fields defined by the Document Template.

The match may take place in multiple ways. CACAO has a sequence of trials and only if none of them succeeds, it returns a validation error. 

The following list shows the different (and sequential) trials:

- **First Trial**: using regular expressions, tries to extract values from the file name (ex: the file name contains the taxpayer id and tax year)
- **Second Trial**: extract the values from the row index (row position)
- **Third Trial**: extract the values from the column index (column position)
- **Fourth Trial**: using regular expressions, tries to match the name of the columns from the files with the Document Template fields

Not every trial is suited for all the file formats. For example, the **Third Trial** trial is not suitable for **JSON** and **XML** types, since one cannot determine column positions as we would in a **CSV** file.

One must remember this is the order of trials. For instance, if the file name does not match the regular expressions defined in the **First Trial** trial, the **Second Trial** trial will be executed.

This sequence is field-wise, it reinitializes for each Document Template's fields attempt of matching. For instance, if the taxpayer id was extracted from the column index (**Third Trial**), for the tax year the sequence begins from the **First Trial**, trying to extract from the file name.

## Archetype

In order to facilitate the creation of Document Templates, CACAO ships some document template **Archetypes**. Those Archetype are pre-filled document templates, for a common set of accounting documents, each with a complete set of fields.

CACAO's archetypes are:

* Chart of Accounts
* General Ledger
* Income Statement
* Opening Balance
* Shareholding
* Generic

To use the Archetypes to kickstart a Document Template creation, select the `Document Templates` option located at the sidebar menu. Then select the `Manage Templates` option on the lower left of the Document Templates list, and finally select the `Archetype` card.

After selecting the desired archetype, CACAO will show the **Edit Document Template** interface. From this point, its possible to further customize the Document Template.

## What are API and why CACAO have them?

An **application programming interface** (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an **API** connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into software.

CACAO expose different API in order to allow taxpayers' information systems to connect directly to CACAO, and execute all actions, such as file uploading, automatically. CACAO's API also allows other information systems from the Tax Administration to interact and share information between them without human intervention. 

> **Attention!**
> All CACAO's API adhere to the same Role Based Access Control that the user interface implements. **Not all API are available to all roles.**
> If you don't have access to a API that you need, please make contact with the Tax Administration.

## Configuring an Access Token

**Before** using any of the CACAO's API, you must create a **access token**. This token will replace the user/password information in order to login on CACAO and access the desired functionality. 

To create an access token, select the `CACAO Configurations` option located at the sidebar menu. Then select the `Token API Configuration`. An interface for managing your access token will be displayed, with the following options:

* **View generated token** shows you the token that you have already created (if any)
* **Generate a new token** creates a new token or replaces the previous one
* The **Delete token** options deletes your token from CACAO

Please, **keep this token information a secret**. Do not share or publish this information.

> **Attention!**
> If you believe your token has been disclosed or compromised, you must access the `Token API Configuration` option and delete it.
> All actions authenticated by the token is of the sole responsibility of its owner. The Tax Administration **do not** have access to the tokens.

## Available API

To list all available API, select the `CACAO Configurations` option located at the sidebar menu. Then select `CACAO API Documentation`. A _Swagger_ interface will be shown.

For each API available, _Swagger_ shows the description of the API, its parameters and responses.

> **Attention!**
> You **must append** your authentication token to the API parameters in order to access them outside the Swagger environment. For instance, suppose your authentication token is **12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-123456789012** and that CACAO is hosted at **wwwcacao.host**. 
> A command line to access the API that lists all available document templates would be like: 
>
> `curl -X GET "https://wwwcacao.host/api/template" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: api-key 12345678-abcd-efgh-ijkl-123456789012"`
>
> where **"Authorization: api-key cbc1d881-b8bc-4e2d-b236-c168b01fc692"** is the parameter that must be included in the header of the API call.
